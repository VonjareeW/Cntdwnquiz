To complete this challenge I viewed the index.html code, from the following directory
"2023-edx/UNCC-VIRT-FSF-PT-07-2023-U-
LOLC/04-Web-APIs/02-
Challenge/Main/index.htm|", After viewing I made a mockup on paper of how I wanted my styling and made modifications from my notes and tips from in-class sessions. I used our class Ai edX program to grasp concepts.
I got plenty of examples from my online tutor , that showed me simpler to complex wavs of getting this task accomplished.
